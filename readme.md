Playing around with SVN.

Run `svn add <filename>` to put files/directories under version control

Run `svn diff` to see modifications.

Run `svn commit -m "Message"` to commit the new version of your file to the repository.

Run `svn update` to bring your working copy “up to date” with the repository.
